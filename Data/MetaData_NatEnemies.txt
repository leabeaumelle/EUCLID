[1] "Arthropods were sampled three times (sessions) in June, August, September, using three sampling methods\nat 9 vineyard sites were two treatments (flower strips vs. grassy strips) were applied to separate plots.\nNatural enemies belonging to 4 orders (Araneae, Neuroptera, Dermaptera, Opiliones) were counted\nand identified to the lowest possible taxonomic resolution. Abundances are sums of number of individuals\ncollected from several sampling units (pitfall traps) per sampling method per session (HOW MANY?). Each row is a taxonomic group,\nwhen there were e.g. no Araneae, a row for Araneae is created with abundance = 0. When there were several species of\n  Araneae, several rows for each species and their respective abundance is created. There are NAs when the sampling\ncould not be done (especially for sweaping (fauchage) and beating (battage) when no vegetation was present \n(due to drought and/or farmer had to remove vegetation.
